# restore-cryotherapy-tracker
Name of Project: Restore Cryotherapy Tracker

Premise of Application:
This application will track cryotherapy sessions including details such as client's name, session details, and type of cryotherapy machine. It will save a log of this information to the client's profile, as well as saving the data from previous sessions for employee reference.

Project Status
This project is currently in development. Users can start a session and pull up clients and their corresponding past sessions.

I am currently implementing the backend with Node.js and Express.js. I will be implementing MongoDB next before deploying.

Installation and Setup Instructions
This application uses React.js, Node.js, Express.js, etc.

Reflection
This project was created in the duration of my 6 months with the CodeSquad bootcamp. The goal of this project was to be able to show all languages and frameworks learned in the bootcamp. 

My main goal behind this project was to fill a necessary void with tracking client sessions. As a Restore Hyper Wellness employee, I am directly affected by this. We manually track clients' sessions on a dry erase board. So this application will allow us to not only make our lives easier, but it will also allow us to see clients' cryotherapy session history. 

Acknowledgements and Support
I am deeply grateful to CodeSquad, the 2025 cohort, and all of the teaching fellows who have helped me along the way. I also want to give a special thank you to my mentor Yusuf Alp for the encouragement and support in my journey.
