Reflection
This project was created in the duration of my 6 months with the CodeSquad bootcamp. The goal of this project was to be able to show all languages and frameworks learned in the bootcamp. 

My main goal behind this project was to fill a necessary void with tracking client sessions. As a Restore Hyper Wellness employee, I am directly affected by this. We manually track clients' sessions on a dry erase board. So this application will allow us to not only make our lives easier, but it will also allow us to see clients' cryotherapy session history.
